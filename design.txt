This spaces lays out the design choices of the dragon breath project.

*** Status Checks ***

Void return types will be "null and void" as much as possible for the sake of 
code clarity and debugging.  Hence, void will be replaced with enum classes that
describe the possible errors/states for a given function, and will be returned
when said error is triggered.  #defines and consts can only be slightly 
descriptive to the programmer, whereas enums are precompiled and not shown as 
useless numbers when presented to the console during testing.  This is why enums
will be common for return types.  Also, it's possinble that the code would be 
capable of dealing with the errors on its own with little intervention. However,
it should be noted that void returns may still be used, but will populate less 
of the code.  Enums will also have an "e_" in front of their names for further 
clarity, just like how "m_" used in front of member identifiers.

*** Windows and Graphics ***

GLFW will be equipped for windows and graphics considering the involvement with 
the OS documentation and API that would be required for accomplishing such a 
task from scratch; perhaps, this will remain as a potential, future direction 
for this project or a separate one. I have considered diving into rasterization
techniques.
