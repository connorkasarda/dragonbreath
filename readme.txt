DRAGON BREATH

-- Summary --

This is a codespace I created for building a soft real-time agent-based
simulation engine. The engine will depend on an Entity Component System (ECS) 
that is built from scratch with the addition of generative AI for the agents. 
Bib file contains sources I used for this project, including an ECS tutorial I 
used for this project.

Cognitive Language Agents (CLA) will be a focus of this project. Each CLA will
have a prompter that communicates with a LLM API, including OPENAI's API. The 
idea is that CLAs will be able to communicate with each other in a virtual 
environment. For example: classroom, coffee shop, library, village, etc.

-- Implementations --

[x] Build ECS from tutorial/walkthrough
[ ] Prompter communication with LLM API
[ ] CLA incorporation into ECS
