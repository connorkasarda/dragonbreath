DRAGON BREATH

-- Summary --

This is a codespace I created for building a soft real-time agent-based
simulation engine. The engine will depend on an Entity Component System (ECS) 
that is built from scratch with the addition of generative AI for the agents. 
Bib file contains sources I used for this project, including an ECS tutorial I 
used for this project.

May consider investigating the use of Python C API. This will allow use of the 
OpenAI package to create generative agents in the soft real-time simulation; the
Large Langauge Models (LLM) used for ChatGPT will be used from OpenAI. However,
there are wrapper APIs available for C++, C#, etc. I might end up using one of 
these for accessing the OpenAI API.
