This is a codespace I created for learning soft real-time interactive
agent-based computer simulations.  Most of the work will be completed from
scratch, with the exception of a few dependencies.  For example, I will use 
opengl in the form of glfw for window and graphics creation.  While I do want
to learn how to render graphics from the bottom up, this work is extensive and 
involves countless quests through the labrynth of OS documentation.  Due to this
reality, I will consider attempting rasterization and vectorization in a later
chapter of my life, perhaps as a separate project or incorporated in this one.

Due to the heightened impact of AI during my time, I will investigate the use of
this technology in simulators and game engines.  Keep in mind, at this time I
cannot predict if all or even any algorithms universally found in game engine or
simulator architecture will be replaced by AI/ML technology.  I simply want to 
embrace the nature of my inner mad scientist and explore the universe for what
it is and test the limits of this type of software.  Is this endeavor a waste of
time?  I honestly have no clue.  Will viewers criticize me?  Probably, and I
won't mind it either;  I'm not the only one with brains afterall.

Finally, I am producing this repository for the sake of educational purposes,
for myself and for others who share in the same feeling of curiosity and/or
interest in the craft.
