DRAGON BREATH

This is a codespace I created for buidling a soft real-time agent-based
simulation engine. The engine will depend on an Entity Component System (ECS) 
that is built from scratch.

May consider investigating the use of Python C API. This will allow use of the 
OpenAI package to create generative agents in the soft real-time simulation; the
Large Langauge Models (LLM) used for ChatGPT will be used from OpenAI.
