This is a codespace I created for learning soft real-time interactive
agent-based computer simulations.  Most of the work will be completed from
scratch, with the exception of a few dependencies.  For example, once I  reach 
the point of implementing the graphics after the skeleton is built, I will use 
opengl in the form of glfw for window and graphics creation.  While I do want
to learn how to render graphics from the bottom up, this work is extensive and 
involves countless quests through the labrynth of OS documentation.  Due to this
reality, I will consider attempting rasterization and vectorization in a later
chapter of my life, perhaps as a separate project or incorporated in this one.

Due to the heightened impact of AI during my time, I will investigate the use of
this technology in simulators and game engines.  Keep in mind, at this time I
cannot predict if all or even any algorithms universally found in game engine or
simulator architecture will be replaced by AI/ML technology.  I simply want to
test the limits of this type of software.

Finally, I am producing this repository for the sake of educational purposes,
for myself and for others who share in the same feeling of curiosity and/or
interest in the craft.
