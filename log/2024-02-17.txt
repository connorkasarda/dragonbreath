I learned about the importance of smart pointers, especially shared pointers.
Further research into the documentation convinced me that shared pointers are
needed when polymorphism and dynamic memory allocation/deallocation is in play.

For example, the base interface IComponentArray was created to allow all
specializations of the template class ComponentArray to belong to the same
mapping in the ComponentManager. In addition, component arrays are dynamically
allocated/deallocated so pointers are required. Therefore, combining these
requirements begs for the use of shared pointers, or shared_ptr.

In adding shared_ptr, I also was forced to discover make_shared.

Yesterday, I came across a piece of media that inspired me to write down my
thoughts during the work process. In other words, a log. Journaling served as a
motivational force for a young man's game development journey. Even if little
or nil was accomplished that day, he put it down in text. No matter what.

This is percisely why I'm writing to the audience today. I feel that my
journals will allow me to process my work and clear my mind for the days to
come. Also, the process of logging my process makes me feel like Captain James
T. Kirk and breathes story into it all.

Not only does this motivate me, it makes me feel that this project has a
meaningful purpose and could help myself and others someday. I can't wait to
see what comes of this project, my growth, and what others do with it. And that
makes me really happy.

Okay, enough cheesy stuff -- let's get to work!
