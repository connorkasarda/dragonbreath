Entity Component System (ECS)

    Entity -- general purpose object consisting of a unique id

    Component -- ties an aspect to a particular Entity

    System -- acts on any Entity with a target Component

Design Choices

    May need to review differences between asserts, exceptions, and remaining
    methods for error checking and handling...using asserts at the moment, yet
    this is only best for development, not production

    Should "using" keyword be replaced with "typedef" keyword?
