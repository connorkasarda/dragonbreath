OPENAI API prompting costs money and requires connection. May turn to implementing my own LLM.
This will be quite the endeavor, but I believe I am capable. My imagination for the LLM organization.

LLM/
|-- src/
|   |-- main.cpp               
|   |-- tokenizer.cpp          
|   |-- transformer.cpp       
|   |-- attention.cpp 
|   |-- language.cpp
|-- include/
|   |-- tokenizer.h
|   |-- transformer.h
|   |-- attention.h
|   |-- language.h	

Also, I will create a folder, called "models/" in which the trained models are stored.
