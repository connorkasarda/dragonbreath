.tpp files. These file types, new to me in C++ programming, were the highlight
of my education today. Initially, I kept all implementations for template
related code within the .h file. At one point, I would even change the type of 
these files to .hpp to recognize the fact that implementations were present.
However, I realized this to be insufficient and perhaps even counterproductive
to the work of the compiler.

It is my vague understanding that without using .tpp files to store template
implementations, the compiler will have a tougher job. So, what I do now is put
template implementations in .tpp files and regular implementations in .cpp 
files for now.

I feel very close to finishing the basic groundwork for this project. Yet, it's
only the first step in a grander scheme; my plan is to make an ECS for all 
kinds of NLP-based games.
