I haven't logged any updates in a while but I think good progress has been made
with the ECS. Shared pointers are making more sense now. I also decided to make
sure that I could "my way" instead of just being a copycat when going through
tutorials online -- I learn much better this way and I'm sure others do too. 
It's uncomfortable when you try to figure it out on your own instead of just
saving time by copying another coder's approach. However, this needs to be
overcome and it's a hurdle all of us need to jump over.

With every day, I feel that hurdle is getting smaller. Sometimes, I still find
myself searching for answers online. To overcome this, I instead try to learn
the code and find the documentation for the functions. This makes me feel more
confident in my abilities and I honestly think my coding is improving.

Next, I will need to create some sort of "captain" or "commander" class that
has and performs the entities, systems, and components. I, personally, like
having the hierarchy approach. You need to make sure the captain knows what
they are doing though. But when they are effective in their commands, commands
can be carried out well and efficiently.
